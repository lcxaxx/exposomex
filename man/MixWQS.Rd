\title{Build weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) model}
\usage{
MixWQS(PID, OutPath = "default", VarsY, VarsX, IncCova = "F", Family,
    VarStrat = "none",RatioValidat = 0.3,q = 10,b = 100,b1_pos = F,b1_constr = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{PID}{chr. Program ID. It must be the same with the PID generated by ExpoMixEffect}

\item{OutPath}{chr. Output file directory, e.g. "D:/test". It should be noted that
the slash symbol is "/", not "\". If "default", the current working directory will be set.}

\item{VarsY}{chr. Outcome variable used for modeling. Only one variable can be entered.}

\item{VarsX}{chr. Exposure variable used for modeling. The default option is
"all.x" (All exposure variables are included). Users can also choose available variables.
It should be noted that there is fixed format for the entering characters
separated with comma and without space, e.g., "X1,X2,X3"}

\item{IncCova}{lgl. T (or TRUE) and F (or FALSE). Whether to include the covariate
selected in the function "FindCovaMix"}

\item{Family}{chr. The link function for the regression model according the data type of outcomes,
including "gaussian" for continuous variable, "binomial" for binary variable,
and "poisson" for counting variable.}

\item{VarStrat}{chr. A factor variable used for stratifying for the model.}

\item{RatioValidat}{num. Percentage of the dataset to be used to validate the model.
If validation = 0 then the test dataset is used as validation dataset too. The default is 0.3.}

\item{q}{num. Levels for ranking mixture variables, e.g. in quartiles (q = 4), deciles (q = 10),
or percentiles (q = 100). The default is 10.}

\item{b}{num. Number of bootstrap samples used in parameter estimation. The default is 100.}

\item{b1_pos}{lgl. T (or TRUE) and F (or FALSE). Whether the beta values were positive
to derive weights from to build models.}

\item{b1_constr}{lgl. T (or TRUE) and F (or FALSE). A logial value that determines
whether to apply positive (if b1_pos = TRUE) or negative (if b1_pos = FALSE) constraints
in the optimization function for the weight estimation.}
}
\value{
A list containing the WQS analysis results.
