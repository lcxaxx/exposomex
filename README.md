### Welcome to ExposomeX platform to expediate the discovery of “Exposure-Biology-Disease” nexus!

Exposome has become the hotspot of next-generation health studies. To date, there is no available effective platform to standardize the analysis of exposomic data. In ExposomeX, we aim to propose one new framework of exposomic analysis and build up one novel integrated platform to expediate the discovery of “Exposure-Biology-Disease” nexus. In ExposomeX, we have built up one integrated platform for exposomic analysis. In total, we have developed SIX major modules, which include exposomic mass spectrometry data processing (E-MS), statistical analyses of “chemicals-endogenous omics-diseases” interaction (E-STAT), exposome database search (E-DB), meta-analysis of chemical-diseases (E-META), biological explanation of chemical-diseases (E-BIO) and visualization of multiple dimension data (E-VIZ). Here, we provide R package "exposomex" to conduct the data analysis. Users can also install part of the packages, i.e., the 14 R packages including extidy, exstat, exviz, exdb, exmo, excros, exmedt, expanel, exsurv, exmix, exnta, exbiolink, exstatlink, and exmeta. User can also use this packages by web-interaction, see: http://www.exposomex.cn. In sum, we have proposed a novel framework for standardized exposomic analysis, which can be accessed using both R and online interactive platform. All the modules will keep updating.
